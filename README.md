A collection of bash scripts to get Arch Linux up and running with ease.

<!-- This is a slightly opinionated setup that uses an EFI boot partition and a BTRFS root partition encrypted with LUKS. There is no swap partition. Swap is provided using the combination of a 2GB swapfile and 1GB of ZRAM. The ZRAM will be the priority swap space before anything is written to the swapfile on disk. -->

## Features :package:

-   EFI
-   BTRFS
-   LUKS Encryption
-   ZRAM
-   Swapfile

## Usage :rocket:

1. Download the latest version of the live ISO from [here](https://www.archlinux.org/download/) and boot into it.

    - If you're installing on bare metal, you'll need to burn the ISO to a USB flash drive. A great tool for this is [Etcher](https://etcher.io/). It is free and open source software.

2. (Optional) Setup WiFi.

    - If you need to connect to WiFi for network connectivity, follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd#iwctl).

3. Confirm internet connectivity.

    ```bash
    ping -c 4 archlinux.org
    ```

4. (Optional) Set the root user password to allow SSH access. This is not required but recommended to allow copy/paste functionality.

    1. Get the IP address of the machine.

        ```bash
        ip a
        ```

    2. Set the root user password.

        ```bash
        passwd root
        ```

    3. From a remote machine SSH into the environment.

        ```bash
        ssh root@<ip>
        ```

5. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damienbutt/arch-base/master/install.sh)"
    ```

6. Follow prompts until the setup is complete.
